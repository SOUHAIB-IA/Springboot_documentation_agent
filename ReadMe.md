## üöÄ Overview

This project is an advanced AI agent designed to automate the tedious process of writing and maintaining technical documentation for Java Spring Boot applications. It leverages a multi-agent architecture where AI agents collaborate to analyze a codebase, write documentation, review the output for accuracy, and assemble a final, polished Markdown document.

The entire process can be monitored in real-time through a sleek "Mission Control" desktop application, which provides a live feed of the agents' thoughts, actions, and the documentation as it's being built.

### ‚ú® Key Features

*   **üß† Multi-Agent Collaboration:** A **Writer Agent** generates content, and a **Reviewer Agent** critiques it by comparing it against the source code, ensuring high accuracy.
*   **üñ•Ô∏è Real-Time Mission Control UI:** A native desktop application built with **Tauri** and **Next.js** provides a live feed of the agent's reasoning process and the generated documentation.
*   **üîê Local-First & Secure:** The application runs locally on your machine. Using Tauri, it can securely access local project folders without exposing them to the web.
*   **ü§ñ Autonomous Operation:** Simply point the agent at a project, and it handles the entire workflow: file discovery, analysis, generation, review, and final publishing.
*   **üìù Comprehensive Markdown Output:** Generates a single, well-organized document with a table of contents, code snippets, and logical sections for Entities, Services, Controllers, and more.
*   **üîÑ Stateful & Resilient:** Uses a vector store for long-term memory and includes robust error handling for network issues, allowing it to continue its work on long-running tasks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project is a monorepo combining a Python back end with a TypeScript/React front end.

| Component      | Technology                                                                          |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Back End**   | **Python**, **FastAPI**, **LangChain** (with **LangGraph**), **Socket.IO**           |
| **LLM**        | **Google Gemini 1.5 Pro** (easily swappable for Groq, OpenAI, etc.)                 |
| **Front End**  | **Next.js**, **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Shadcn/ui**             |
| **Desktop App**| **Tauri** (Rust-based)                                                              |
| **Real-Time**  | **WebSockets** (via `python-socketio` and `socket.io-client`)                       |
| **Memory**     | **ChromaDB** (Vector Store) with **Sentence Transformers** (Local Embeddings)       |

### üèõÔ∏è Architectural Flow

The system operates as a stateful graph where a manager orchestrates tasks, one file at a time.

## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js** (v18 or later)
*   **Python** (v3.11 or later)
*   **Rust & System Dependencies** for Tauri. Follow the [official Tauri guide](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites) for your operating system.
*   A **Google Gemini API Key**.

### 1. Back-End Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

# Set up a Python virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create the environment file
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, open the `.env` file and add your Google Gemini API key:

```env
# .env
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key-goes-here..."
```

### 2. Front-End Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the front-end directory
cd springboot-doc-agent-frontend  # Or your front-end folder name

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install
```

### 3. Running the Application

This application requires **two separate terminal sessions** to run concurrently.

**Terminal 1: Start the Back-End Server**

```bash
# From the project root directory
source .venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```
You should see Uvicorn start the server on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.

**Terminal 2: Launch the Front-End Desktop App**

```bash
# From the front-end directory (e.g., springboot-doc-agent-frontend)
npm run tauri dev
```
After the initial compilation, the native desktop "Mission Control" window will appear.

---

## üìñ How to Use

1.  **Launch the application** using the two-terminal setup described above.
2.  In the Mission Control window, click **"Browse for Project..."**.
3.  A native file dialog will open. Select the **root folder** of the Spring Boot project you want to document.
4.  Click **"Launch Agent"**.
5.  **Watch the magic!** The "Agent Feed" will populate with the real-time thoughts and actions of the agents.
6.  Once the process is complete, the final documentation will appear in the "Documentation Preview" panel. You can then **copy** it or **download** it as a `.md` file.

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

Please see the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for our code of conduct and the process for submitting pull requests.

### Areas for Contribution

*   **‚ûï More Tools:** Add new tools for the agents, such as a `dependency_analysis_tool` (reads `pom.xml`/`build.gradle`) or a `database_schema_tool`.
*   **üß† Smarter Agents:** Improve the prompts to handle more complex code structures or edge cases.
*   **üé® UI/UX Enhancements:** Add features to the Mission Control dashboard, like a "Diff Viewer" for re-runs or a project history panel.
*   **üß™ Better Testing:** Expand the test suite for both the front-end and back-end components.
*   **üåê Broader Language Support:** Adapt the agent to document projects in other languages (e.g., Python/Django, Node.js/Express).

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

*   [ ] **Project History & Diff Viewer:** Allow users to view past documentation runs and compare versions.
*   [ ] **Configuration Editor:** A UI to edit agent prompts and parameters directly from the Mission Control dashboard.
*   [ ] **Support for Other LLMs:** Add a settings panel to easily switch between Gemini, Groq, and local models.
*   [ ] **Automated Diagram Generation:** Integrate a tool that generates Mermaid.js diagrams (e.g., class or sequence diagrams) from the code.
